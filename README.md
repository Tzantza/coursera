# 📚 COURSERA Projects

This folder contains some of the practical projects I completed during my Coursera studies, focused on **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning**.

## 🗂️ What you’ll find here

- **Notebooks with EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Predictive models**: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and model tuning using Pipelines and GridSearchCV.
- **Visualizations**: Charts created with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Notes and code samples**: Well-commented Python scripts, clean and organized.

## ⚙️ Main libraries used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📌 Purpose

To showcase my practical development as a **Data Analyst**, applying what I learned through hands-on, reproducible projects.

## 🌟 Highlighted Machine Learning Project

I have also worked on a **Machine Learning** project that demonstrates my ability to implement predictive models, model evaluation, and tuning. Check out the project below:
