# üìö COURSERA Projects

This folder contains some of the practical projects I completed during my Coursera studies, focused on **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning**.

## üóÇÔ∏è What you‚Äôll find here

- **Notebooks with EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Predictive models**: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and model tuning using Pipelines and GridSearchCV.
- **Visualizations**: Charts created with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Notes and code samples**: Well-commented Python scripts, clean and organized.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main libraries used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## üìå Purpose

To showcase my practical development as a **Data Analyst**, applying what I learned through hands-on, reproducible projects.

## üåü Highlighted 

I have also worked on a **Machine Learning** project that demonstrates my ability to implement predictive models, model evaluation, and tuning. Check out the project below:

As part of my Coursera learning path, I also completed the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**, which included a rigorous **SQL final exam project**.  

In this project, I demonstrated my ability to:
- Write complex SQL queries,
- Use joins, aggregations, subqueries and window functions,
- Extract, clean, and transform data from relational databases,
- And generate meaningful insights to support data-driven decisions.

I also developed a **Web Scraping project**, where I built a custom Python **spider bot** to automatically extract structured data from websites.  

In this project, I:
- Designed a scraping pipeline using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`,
- Handled dynamic content and pagination,
- Stored the scraped data in a clean, reusable format,
- And transformed raw web data into a dataset ready for analysis.
